\section{Introduction}
        The introduction outlines the purpose and scope of the project. 
        This section is responsible for defining any prerequisite acronyms and terms used in the document. 
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of this document is to lay out the requirements of \CapstoneTeamName. 
        This document is a mutual agreement between both parties outlining what will be produced. 
        The intended audience is those who will be working on \CapstoneTeamName and the client for whom \CapstoneTeamName is for.
    \subsection{Scope}
        \botname will be a speech-based virtual assistant for Fusion 360 that lets users perform any one of a subset of tasks within the product, such as saving a document or opening a menu, by verbally instructing it to perform the task.
        Workflows in Fusion 360 that are not suited for handling by a voice interface will not be supported by \botname.
        As a stretch goal, \botname will be capable of questioning user and storing responses to use to predict and automatically assist with future user behavior.
        It will be a plugin that is bundled with Fusion 360 and will be part of the product's standard download.

        \botname will offer users a tool that decreases the time required to achieve their goals within Fusion 360 by offering an interface that runs in parallel with and complements the keyboard and mouse.
        If the stretch goal is achieved, \botname will further increase productivity by learning to predict and automate specific workflows within the product.

    \subsection{Overview}
        %This section describes the contents and organization of the rest of the document. 
        The rest of this document contains a user story outlining intended uses and specific functionalities of \botname as well as assumptions, dependencies, and design constraints. 

\section{Overall Description}
    \subsection{Product Perspective}

        %\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
            %TODO: Revisit this. I'm not sure if it is applicable to this project.
        \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
            The user will interact with \botname via voice commands spoken in English. 
            Therefore to be supported, a device must have a mic.
            In the case of the stretch goal, \botname will periodically speak back to the user to receive insights into the user's actions.

        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} %Included above in the User Interfaces section
            \botname should be supported on desktop and laptop computers that support Fusion 360 and have microphones to receive the user's speech.
            For stretch goal support, devices will also need speakers through which \botname can speak back to the user.
            %TODO: Any other devices? Is there anything else that supports Fusion?

        \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}               
            %TODO: Should the API version/specific open source projects being used be added here?
            \botname needs to translate supported speech commands received from the user to the equivalent tasks within the user's Fusion project.
            The Fusion source code will not be available for modification, thus the commands will need to be executed via the existing Fusion API.
            To translate the commands, the audio recorded by the user interface will need to be processed by a speech-to-text application.
            The resulting output will need to be parsed a another application that can derive meaning from natural language text.
            Finally, the derived meaning will need to have a deterministic mapping to a Fusion API call and thus to a specific task inside of Fusion.
            %TODO: Insert block diagram here.
            %TODO: Describe software interfaces for stretch goal where UI communicates back to user then stores/uses responses
        %\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}                

        \subsubsection{Memory} 
            \botname should require at most \totalMemoryRequirement of memory to perform the work necessary to add its functionality to Fusion.
            For the stretch goal of storing data related to user responses to questions from \botname, there are no memory caps at this time on the amount of data that can be stored.

        %\subsubsection{Operations}
                %TODO: I'm not sure what this section means.

        \subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements} 
            Since \botname interacts with Fusion 360 using existing architecture, Fusion will not need to be modified to support it. 

    \subsection{Product Functions}
		\botname will provide a natural language interface for users, this allows the user to perform many tasks through verbal commands.
		The variety of commmands is large and some examples are saving items, extrude items, or rotating the camera view.
		These voice commands will allow the user to control Fusion360 to the
		
		\botname will periodically ask the users questions regarding the operations they execute.
		In order to start an interview \botname must be able to first recognize a situation where it should be asking a question.
		Then \botname will have to compile a question from infromation mined from the context of the operation in question.
		Once \botname has figured out what to ask it, it must then be able to articule that question into speech.
		For this workflow to create anything useful, the response from the user must be saved for future use.
		\botname will  record user responses and save a transcript along with conextual information.
		The responses to these questions will be used to train \botname to become an intelligent virtual assitant.
		
    \subsection{User Characteristics}
		\botname will have two types of users administrators and, designers. 
		Administrators will have special access to \botname that allows them to perform maintaince.
		\botname must be trained and maintained in order for it to understand different articulations of words and phrases. 
		This maintaince will be in the form of training exercises where administrators will speak with \botname and provide feedback to the system.
		
		The primary and intended user is the designers whom are using Fusion360. 
		Designers building things using Fusion will also be the primary users for \botname.
		Fusion360 users are trying to design or build somthing and as such are more likely to be technically oriented.
		however the software is widely available, so the user could technically be simply anyone who has access to Fusion360.
		At the moment \botname will be designed only to work with Fusion meaning \botname is limited to only Fusion360 users. 

    \subsection{Constraints}
		\botname will be constrained by the API provided by Fusion360. \botname is a plugin for Fusion360 that means \botname will be limited to the API that Fusion360 has made available. 

    \subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

   		 \subsection{Performance Requirements}
    		The section covers the numerical performance requirements of the system
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 1}
        TITLE: Number  of users \\
        DESCRIPTION: \botname can handle one user at time
        RATIONAL: Only one user is using the Fusion at a time. 
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 2}
        TITLE: Voice command to Fusion action time \\
        DESCRIPTION: A Fusion action shall take place within one a second of the user's voice command.
        RATIONAL: This window is fast enough for a user's satisfaction and slow enough to allow \botname to process fully.
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 3}
        TITLE: Number  of users \\
        DESCRIPTION: \botname can handle one user at time
        RATIONAL: Only one user is using the Fusion at a time. 
        
    \subsection{Design Constraints}
    	\CapstoneTeamName doesn't have access to the Fusion source code. Therefore, \CapstoneTeamName is constrained by the depth and breadth of the Fusion API in the creation of \botname.
        
    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
	   	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	   	SCALE: The desired task is performed, i.e. if \botname is capable of performing the desired action then it shall be able to understand the voice command and successfully execute the Fusion action.\\
	   	METER: Measurements obtained from 10 trials per possible command during testing.\\
	   	MUST: More than 75\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	PLAN: More than 80\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	WISH: 90\% of achievable voice commands.\\
   
		

\section{Release Plan}
	The develop of \botname is very sequential. Each step's development and success depends on how the previous step was implemented. For that reason, \CapstoneProjectName's release plan remains tentative. Below is a Gantt chart outlining \botname's development plan.
