\section{Introduction}
        The introduction outlines the purpose and scope of the project. 
        This section is responsible for defining any prerequisite acronyms and terms used in the document. 
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of this document is to lay out the requirements of \CapstoneTeamName. 
        This document is a mutual agreement between both parties outlining what will be produced. 
        The intended audience is those who will be working on \CapstoneTeamName and the client for whom \CapstoneTeamName is for.
    \subsection{Scope}
        \botname will be a speech-based virtual assistant for Fusion 360 that lets users perform any one of a subset of tasks within the product, such as saving a document or opening a menu, by verbally instructing it to perform the task.
        Workflows in Fusion 360 that are not suited for handling by a voice interface will not be supported by \botname.
        As a stretch goal, \botname will be capable of questioning user and storing responses to use to predict and automatically assist with future user behavior.
        It will be a plugin that is bundled with Fusion 360 and will be part of the product's standard download.

        \botname will offer users a tool that decreases the time required to achieve their goals within Fusion 360 by offering an interface that runs in parallel with and complements the keyboard and mouse.
        If the stretch goal is achieved, \botname will further increase productivity by learning to predict and automate specific workflows within the product.

    \subsection{Overview}
        %This section describes the contents and organization of the rest of the document. 
        The rest of this document contains a user story outlining intended uses and specific functionalities of \botname as well as assumptions, dependencies, and design constraints. 

\section{Overall Description}
    \subsection{Product Perspective}

        %\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
            %TODO: Revisit this. I'm not sure if it is applicable to this project.
        \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
            The user will interact with \botname via voice commands spoken in English. 
            Therefore to be supported, a device must have a mic.
            In the case of the stretch goal, \botname will periodically speak back to the user to receive insights into the user's actions.

        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} %Included above in the User Interfaces section
            \botname should be supported on desktop and laptop computers that support Fusion 360 and have microphones to receive the user's speech.
            For stretch goal support, devices will also need speakers through which \botname can speak back to the user.
            %TODO: Any other devices? Is there anything else that supports Fusion?

        \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}               
            %TODO: Should the API version/specific open source projects being used be added here?
            \botname needs to translate supported speech commands received from the user to the equivalent tasks within the user's Fusion project.
            The Fusion source code will not be available for modification, thus the commands will need to be executed via the existing Fusion API.
            To translate the commands, the audio recorded by the user interface will need to be processed by a speech-to-text application.
            The resulting output will need to be parsed a another application that can derive meaning from natural language text.
            Finally, the derived meaning will need to have a deterministic mapping to a Fusion API call and thus to a specific task inside of Fusion.
            %TODO: Insert block diagram here.
            %TODO: Describe software interfaces for stretch goal where UI communicates back to user then stores/uses responses
        %\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}                

        \subsubsection{Memory} 
            \botname should require at most \totalMemoryRequirement of memory to perform the work necessary to add its functionality to Fusion.
            For the stretch goal of storing data related to user responses to questions from \botname, there are no memory caps at this time on the amount of data that can be stored.

        %\subsubsection{Operations}
            %TODO: I'm not sure what this section means.

        \subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements} 
            Since \botname interacts with Fusion using existing architecture, Fusion will not need to be modified to support it. 

    \subsection{Product Functions}
        \botname will allow the user to perform tasks in Fusion via a voice interface. 
        Each voice command given by the user will be mapped to a specific task which will then be performed in the open Fusion project. \\
       
        As a stretch goal, \botname will periodically ask the users questions regarding why they have performed specific tasks.
        The questions asked by \botname will pertains to specific predefined contexts.
		\botname will record user responses and save a transcript along with contextual information.
        
    \subsection{User Characteristics}
		\botname will have two types of users: administrators and designers. 
		Administrators will have access to data collected by \botname including the command logs and, if the stretch goal is accomplished, user responses to questions from \botname. 
		
		The primary user is the designer who is working on projects inside of Fusion. 
        Due to the technical knowledge needed to work within Fusion, it can be assumed that designers are technically oriented.
        However, know extra knowledge outside of that needed to operate Fusion will be needed to user \botname.
        
    \subsection{Constraints}
        Since the application will not have access to any parts of the Fusion source code,
        \botname will be constrained in what tasks it can perform by what is offered in the Fusion API. 

    \subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
        The stretch goal assumes that the Fusion API offers a way to view actions the user performs with their keyboard and mouse.
        Without this capability, the application's knowledge of user actions will be constrained to the actions that the user performs through \botname.

\section{Specific Requirements}
    \subsection{External Interface}
       First time users of \botname should be presented with an onboarding process with an interactive demo.
       The onboarding process should start with a popup that introduces \botname with a concise description of its purpose.
       The user should then be able to click "Next" to transition to an interactive demo.
       The interactive demo should consists of several sequential popups that each ask the user to tell \botname to perform a specific command.
       This will make the user aware of \botname and what it is capable of.

    \subsection{Design Constraints}
    	\CapstoneTeamName doesn't have access to the Fusion source code. Therefore, \CapstoneTeamName is constrained by the depth and breadth of the Fusion API in the creation of \botname.
        
    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
	   	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	   	SCALE: The desired task is performed, i.e. if \botname is capable of performing the desired action then it shall be able to understand the voice command and successfully execute the Fusion action.\\
	   	METER: Measurements obtained from 10 trials per possible command during testing.\\
	   	MUST: More than 75\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	PLAN: More than 80\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	WISH: 90\% of achievable voice commands.\\
   
		

\section{Release Plan}
	The develop of \botname is very sequential. Each step's development and success depends on how the previous step was implemented. For that reason, \CapstoneProjectName's release plan remains tentative. Below is a Gantt chart outlining \botname's development plan.
