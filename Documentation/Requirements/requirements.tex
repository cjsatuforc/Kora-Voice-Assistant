\section{Introduction}
        The introduction outlines the purpose and scope of the project. 
        This section is responsible for defining any prerequisite acronyms and terms used in the document. 
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of this document is to lay out the requirements of \CapstoneTeamName. 
        This document is a mutual agreement between both parties outlining what will be produced. 
        The intended audience is those who will be working on \CapstoneTeamName and the client for whom \CapstoneTeamName is for.
    \subsection{Scope}
        \botname will be a speech-based virtual assistant for Fusion 360 that lets users perform any one of a subset of tasks within the product, such as saving a document or opening a menu, by verbally instructing it to perform the task.
        Workflows in Fusion 360 that are not suited for handling by a voice interface will not be supported by \botname.
        As a stretch goal, \botname will be capable of questioning user and storing responses to use to predict and automatically assist with future user behavior.
        It will be a plugin that is bundled with Fusion 360 and will be part of the product's standard download.

        \botname will offer users a tool that decreases the time required to achieve their goals within Fusion 360 by offering an interface that runs in parallel with and complements the keyboard and mouse.
        If the stretch goal is achieved, \botname will further increase productivity by learning to predict and automate specific workflows within the product.

\section{Specific Requirements}
    \subsection{External Interface}
    \subsection{Functional Requirements}
    This section includes the requirements that specify all the fundamental actions of the software system.
    	\subsubsection{Functional Requirement 1}
        TITLE: Convert voice to text \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to hear voice english statements and output their english text equivalent.
        RATIONAL: This must be done to understand the user's command 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 2}
        TITLE: Error State \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall inform the user that it can't perform an operation or doesn't understand what the user's commanded is in an error state \\
        RATIONAL: This must be done to inform the user 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 3}
        TITLE: Correspond voice command to Fusion 360 action  \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to correspond the produced text equivalent described in FR1 to the correct Fusion action
        RATIONAL: This must be done to run commands in Fusion 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 4}
        TITLE: Send commands to Fusion  \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to send the generated action from FR2 to Fusion
        RATIONAL: This is the last step in the voice command to Fusion action pipeline 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 5}
        TITLE: Extrude shape by voice \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to extrude a shape accordingly in Fusion by a command similar to "extrude by 5mm."
        RATIONAL: This is the first step in prototype demo 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 6}
        TITLE: Rotate camera by voice \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to rotate the Fusion camera by a command similar to "rotate the design 90 degrees to the left." 
        RATIONAL: This is the second step in prototype demo 
        
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirement 7}
        TITLE: Save design by voice \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to save a Fusion design by a voice command similar to "save my design as \textit{my\_draft\_1.f3d}."
        RATIONAL: This is the last step in prototype demo 
        
        %	%
        %	Below are stretch goals
        %	%
        
        \subsubsection{Stretch Functional Requirement 1}
        TITLE: What interview question to ask \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to generate an interview question
        RATIONAL: This is the first step in collecting user reasoning data. 
        
        
        \subsubsection{Stretch Functional Requirement 2}
        TITLE: When to ask an interview question \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be aware of when it is appropriate to ask a question.
        RATIONAL: This is the second step in collecting user reasoning data. 
        
        \subsubsection{Stretch Functional Requirement 3}
        TITLE: Ask a question \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to ask a question to the user.
        RATIONAL: This is the third step in collecting user reasoning data. 
        
        \subsubsection{Stretch Functional Requirement 4}
        TITLE: Output interview text to a file \\
        DESCRIPTION: The system shall be able to output an interview question paired with the user's answer to a file.
        RATIONAL: This is the last step in collecting user reasoning data. 
        

   		 \subsection{Performance Requirements}
    		The section covers the numerical performance requirements of the system
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 1}
        TITLE: Number  of users \\
        DESCRIPTION: \botname can handle one user at time
        RATIONAL: Only one user is using the Fusion at a time. 
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 2}
        TITLE: Voice command to Fusion action time \\
        DESCRIPTION: A Fusion action shall take place within one a second of the user's voice command.
        RATIONAL: This window is fast enough for a user's satisfaction and slow enough to allow \botname to process fully.
        
        \subsubsection{Performance Requirement 3}
        TITLE: Number  of users \\
        DESCRIPTION: \botname can handle one user at time
        RATIONAL: Only one user is using the Fusion at a time. 
        
    \subsection{Design Constraints}
    	\CapstoneTeamName doesn't have access to the Fusion source code. Therefore, \CapstoneTeamName is constrained by the depth and breadth of the Fusion API in the creation of \botname.
        
    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
	   	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	   	SCALE: The desired task is performed, i.e. if \botname is capable of performing the desired action then it shall be able to understand the voice command and successfully execute the Fusion action.\\
	   	METER: Measurements obtained from 10 trials per possible command during testing.\\
	   	MUST: More than 75\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	PLAN: More than 80\% of achievable voice commands.\\
	   	WISH: 90\% of achievable voice commands.\\
   
		

\section{Release Plan}
	The develop of \botname is very sequential. Each step's development and success depends on how the previous step was implemented. For that reason, \CapstoneProjectName's release plan remains tentative. Below is a Gantt chart outlining \botname's development plan.
    \subsection{Release plan}
